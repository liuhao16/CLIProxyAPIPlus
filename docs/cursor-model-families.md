# Cursor model families

Cursor can advertise separate model IDs for reasoning effort, thinking, and
speed, such as `claude-opus-5-thinking-high-fast`. The proxy also registers
family IDs derived from that account's advertised catalog, so clients can
select one model and send its options separately.

For example, when the corresponding variant is available:

```json
{
  "model": "cursor/claude-opus-5",
  "reasoning": { "effort": "high" },
  "service_tier": "priority",
  "input": "Hello"
}
```

This Responses request selects `claude-opus-5-thinking-high-fast`. The
`cursor/` prefix in this example is an auth configuration prefix; use the
prefix configured for your account, or omit it when none is configured.

| API | Effort | Thinking | Fast speed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Responses | `reasoning.effort` | Named effort selects thinking variants when present; `none` selects non-thinking | `service_tier: "priority"` |
| Chat Completions | `reasoning_effort` | Same as Responses | `service_tier: "priority"` |
| Claude Messages | `output_config.effort`, or normalized `thinking.budget_tokens` | `thinking.type`: `enabled`, `adaptive`, or `disabled` | `speed: "fast"` |

Without explicit options, a family uses its exact base ID when available.
Otherwise, it prefers a thinking variant when that dimension exists, medium
effort followed by high, and standard speed. Only advertised variants can be
selected. Unsupported combinations return HTTP 400 rather than silently
selecting a different effort or speed.

Families with neither effort nor thinking variants ignore effort/thinking
values sent by harness defaults. For example, Composer 2.5 accepts a request
containing `reasoning.effort: "medium"` but only its speed setting affects
variant selection. This does not add reasoning controls to Composer.

Canonical model suffixes such as `claude-opus-5(high)` also select family
options and take precedence over body effort and thinking settings.
Thinking-only families advertise thinking support even without effort levels.

Explicit variant IDs retain their existing behavior. Original models remain
in the catalog alongside family IDs, so clients should curate their picker
if they want only families. Model exclusions are applied before deriving
families and remain effective during variant resolution. Available options
can differ between accounts; advertised family effort levels do not imply
that every effort/thinking/speed combination exists.

If a selected account lacks a requested combination, the proxy tries another
eligible account within the configured credential-attempt limit. These misses
do not cool down the account or family. If the available attempts are exhausted,
the request returns HTTP 400; invalid options stop immediately without rotation.
Canceled model refreshes retain both the previous registration and its filtered
routing catalog.

This routing feature does not change tool translation or streaming behavior,
and does not establish compatibility of every Cursor model with every harness.
